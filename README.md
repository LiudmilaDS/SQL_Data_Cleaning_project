This project is based on a tutorial by Alex The Analyst, demonstrating effective data cleaning techniques. The dataset was cleaned following the tutorial’s steps, resulting in a 
high-quality dataset suitable for further analysis.

Key steps and accomplishments:

1. Duplicates removal: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
2. Data standardization: Ensured consistency by standardizing text data across multiple columns, such as company names, industries, and countries, which were initially inconsistent and 
unstructured.
3. Null and blank values handling: Managed missing and blank data.
4. Redundant columns removal: Analyzed and removed irrelevant or redundant columns that did not contribute to the overall analysis, improving the dataset’s efficiency.

Thanks to this project, I gained hands-on experience with data cleaning methodologies and improved my proficiency in using MySQL for data manipulation.
