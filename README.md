# Data Cleaning Project

This project is based on a tutorial by Alex The Analyst, demonstrating effective data cleaning techniques. The dataset was cleaned following the tutorial’s steps, resulting in a high-quality dataset suitable for further analysis.

## Key Steps and Accomplishments

1. **Duplicates Removal:**
   - Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure the integrity of the dataset.

2. **Data Standardization:**
   - Ensured consistency by standardizing text data across multiple columns, including company names, industries, and countries, which were initially inconsistent and unstructured.

3. **Null and Blank Values Handling:**
   - Managed missing and blank data effectively to maintain data quality.

4. **Redundant Columns Removal:**
   - Analyzed and removed irrelevant or redundant columns that did not contribute to the overall analysis, improving the dataset’s efficiency.

## Skills and Tools

- **Data Cleaning Methodologies:** Gained hands-on experience with essential data cleaning techniques.
- **MySQL:** Improved proficiency in using MySQL for data manipulation.

## Project Outcomes

This project resulted in a clean, well-structured dataset ready for analysis. The process provided valuable experience in applying data cleaning methodologies and working with MySQL.

## Repository Structure
